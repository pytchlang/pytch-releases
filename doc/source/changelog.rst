-------------------

* Bugfix: With the stage at a non-default size (as happens when the
  user drags the divider), the location of a mouse click was computed
  incorrectly, leading to wrong ``when_this_sprite_clicked``
  behaviour.  Click coordinates are now computed correctly.

  this lets them see more of the tutorial.  (Thanks to Eoin Condron
  for report.)


v0.0.4 (2021-01-08)
-------------------

* Add methods ``Sprite.next_costume()`` and ``Stage.next_backdrop()``.

  ``Stage.switch_backdrop()`` to accept a zero-based integer for
  the costume or backdrop to switch to, as an alternative to the
  existing string name.

  ``Stage.backdrop_number``, and ``Stage.backdrop_name``.
